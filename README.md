# Reinforcement Learning for Guitar Signal Reproduction

Can a reinforcement learning agent recreate any guitar signal using just a guitar and pedal configurations?

This project aims to model the behavior of guitar signal processing using reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, it explores whether an RL agent can match a target audio output by controlling virtual guitar effects pedals.

---

## Project Objective

The goal is to simulate a virtual signal chain where an RL agent learns to reproduce arbitrary guitar tones. The system will be trained to match target audio clips by adjusting pedal settings within a selected synthesized environment.

## To-Do

- [ ] **Implement the guitar synthesizer**  
  Build a component to generate clean or distorted guitar signals in response to MIDI or waveform input.

- [ ] **Preprocess audio**  
  Prepare datasets (e.g., spectrograms, normalization, framing) for RL training and evaluation.

- [ ] **Create RL algorithm using Stable-Baselines3**  
  Design and train an RL agent whose actions represent pedal configurations, and whose reward is based on similarity to a target audio signal.
